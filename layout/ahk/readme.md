`Xarty.ahk` does not have extend layers or any other fancy stuff.<br>
`Xarty-with-extend.ahk` implements 3 extend layers and compose. [Check the Wiki on GitHub for details](https://github.com/CarrieForle/xarty/wiki/Xarty-with-AHK)<br>
`Xarty-extend-variation.ahk` is `Xarty-with-extend.ahk` with different implentation of extend layer switching. In hopes of ceasing the random lagspike and CPU-spike in the original script.
`Xarty-compose-variant.ahk` is `Xarty-extend-variationahk` with different implentation of Compose. In hopes of none.

# XARTY - an ecgonomic layout attempt (Concept)

![](https://github.com/CarrieForle/really-optimized-english/assets/53133715/ba05772a-2144-490f-b4fa-d3e74eb3f9b2)

A keyboard layout aimed for typing English in a comfortable and quick manner, which don't take the compatibility to other languages and shortcut friendliness into account.<br> 
<br>
The key placement is heavily based on [first20hours/google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).<br>
<br>
The current layout is putting into test by me. Feel free to suggest your idea for change in [Discussion](https://github.com/CarrieForle/really-optimized-english/discussions).

## Download
[PKL](https://github.com/CarrieForle/really-optimized-english/releases/latest/download/roe.zip)

## Install
You need to download the latest version of [Portable Keyboard Layout](https://github.com/Portable-Keyboard-Layout/Portable-Keyboard-Layout) if you haven't. Extract `xarty.zip` and put the extracted folder to `/layouts/` in PKL. Open `pkl.ini` in PKL and change to the line `layout = roe`.

## Why is ths layout *like this?*
1. Typing with pinkies is **awful**, so this is a six-finger (index, middle, ring) dominant layout.
2. The priority is that the most used keys are reachable with the 6 fingers while being as comfortable with [Bigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram). The best scenario is the 2 keys being typed with separate hands. The worst is it have to be typed with the same finger, followed by pinky to ring and up pinky to the down outmost index and vise versa. The layout is arranged in a way that find a balance of most common [Bigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) is typed with different hands and most common keys typed with the 6 fingers.
3. The left hand, in theory, will work more in the long term. precisely, about `150 per 10,000 keys pressed`. That is, if you do not consider the puctuation. While there seems to have no agreement in punctuation frequency, after I examine the different researches I found on the internet, somewhere in `230 ~ 300 per 10,000 keys pressed` is reasonable. You might think this turns out that the layout is, in fact, putting more pressure on the right hand, and you will be right. Unfortunately, this is the best I can get without breaking point \#2 or entirely rearrange the layout. An idea for improvement is always welcomed in [Discussion](https://github.com/CarrieForle/really-optimized-english/discussions).

## Why ANSI?
I'm using ANSI.

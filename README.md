# Really Optimized English (Concept)

![](https://github.com/CarrieForle/really-optimized-english/assets/53133715/ba05772a-2144-490f-b4fa-d3e74eb3f9b2)

A keyboard layout aimed for typing English as fast as posstble, which don't take the compatibility to other languages and shortcut friendliness into account.<br> 
<br>
The key placement is heavily based on [first20hours/google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english).<br>
<br>
The current layout is putting into test by me. Feel free to suggest your idea for change in [Discussion](https://github.com/CarrieForle/really-optimized-english/discussions).
